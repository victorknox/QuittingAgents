### Contribution Guidelines

1. Always work on a new branch for each contribution. Do not make changes directly to the `main` or `master` branch.
2. Make sure to pull the latest changes from the upstream before making a pull request.
3. Ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's coding and documentation standards.

### Adding New Test Cases
Before you start, please carefully read and understand how the test case is [specified](assets/README.md#test-case-specification) and [curated](./scripts/generation/README.md#test-case-curation).


1. Navigate to the [`assets/contrib/cases`](assets/contrib/cases) directory.
2. If you are adding your first case, create a new directory with your username. Otherwise, navigate to your existing directory.
3. Create a new file or edit an existing one with your test cases.
    - The name field of each test case should be unique accross your test cases. <!-- and should not be changed. -->
4. Ensure that your test cases follow the same format as the existing ones.
    - Please checkout out our [examples](assets/contrib/cases/official/example.json) for more details.
5. Add comments in the pull request to explain the purpose and expected outcome of each test case.
    - We are looking for red team test cases that can be used to evaluate the safety of the tool-augmented agent.
    - Please use [`scripts/emulate.py`](scripts/emulate.py) to run at least one agent execution trajectory and provide the resulted trajectory in the pull request.

### Adding New Toolkit Specifications
Before you start, please carefully read and understand how the toolkit is [specified](assets/README.md#tool-specification) and [curated](./scripts/generation/README.md#toolkit-curation).

1. Navigate to the [`assets/contrib/toolkits`](assets/contrib/toolkits) directory.
2. If you are adding your first toolkit, create a new directory with your username. Otherwise, navigate to your existing directory.
3. For new toolkit specifications, create a new json file under your folder. For updates, modify the existing file.
    - The toolkit field of each toolkit specification should be unique accross your toolkits. <!-- and should not be changed. -->
4. Ensure that your toolkit follow the same format as the existing ones.
    - Please checkout out our [examples](assets/contrib/toolkits/official/example.json) for more details.
5. Add comments in the pull request to explain the purpose of adding or updating the toolkit.
    - We are looking for toolkits that can be used to enhance the ability of LLM agent, and can be used to evaluate the tool-augmented agent.
    - Please also provide at least one test case that uses the toolkit.

### Contributing Codes
